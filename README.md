# Fake News Detection ( End to End Machine Learning Project )

In this project, we have made a machine learning model to predict whether a News is real or not. For this, we have used kaggle to collect data. We have done data cleaning, preprocessing and model building. For checking the performance of model, we have used accuracy score as the dataset is balanced.
